<h3 class="Header3" id="Header3"><u>Future Projects</u></h3>
<p3 class="Paragraph3" id="Paragraph3">I'm learning Computer Science because the world is becoming more and more <strong>digital</strong> so being able to understand computers, how they work and how to code is very important. I will take these skills I learn and use them in the future, whether it's in my future job or in a coding project such as creating a game or more websites.</p3>
